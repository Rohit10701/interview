# Interviewer Expectations: Middleware Router

## What They Are Testing
- Request, Response.
- Route, RouteMatcher.
- Middleware function/interface.
- Router with register and handle.
- ErrorHandler middleware.

## Minimum Strong Answer
- Starts with clarifying scope and choosing the main consistency boundary.
- Identifies the core nouns and separates data objects from services.
- Gives the main happy-path flow before discussing every edge case.
- Names the data structure or SQL transaction that protects correctness.
- Mentions tests that prove the design works.

## Higher-Signal Answer
- Uses small interfaces for volatile choices such as strategy, repository, provider, clock, or payment gateway.
- Makes state transitions explicit instead of allowing arbitrary status mutation.
- Handles retries, idempotency, concurrency, and stale data where the domain needs it.
- Explains one simpler interview version and one production version.
- Knows when not to overuse patterns.

## Data Model / SQL Signal
No SQL. This is a framework/library design problem.

## Evaluation Rubric
- 30 percent: clear entities, ownership, and API boundaries.
- 25 percent: correct main flow and state transitions.
- 20 percent: data structure or SQL correctness.
- 15 percent: concurrency, idempotency, and edge cases.
- 10 percent: code quality, tests, and communication.

## Red Flags
- Middleware order reversed accidentally.
- No short-circuit support for auth failures.
- Path params not passed to handler.
- Route precedence ambiguous.
- Errors leak stack traces instead of standardized responses.
